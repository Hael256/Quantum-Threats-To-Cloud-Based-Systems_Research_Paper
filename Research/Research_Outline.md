# Known and Theoretical Quantum Threats to Cloud-Based Systems and Preventative Methodologies

## Areas of Research
- #### What is a cloud-based system
	- [NIST Definition](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-145.pdf)
- #### How may cloud-based systems be attacked (overview, with corresponding quantum threats elaborated on)
- #### Known Threats
	- Classical Cryptographic Methods vs. Post-Quantum Cryptography
	- Digital Signature Impersonation (from cracking signature cryptographic schemes)
	- Breaking Asymmetric Encryption (Via Shor’s algorithm)
	- Weakening Symmetric Encryption (Via Grover’s algorithm)
- #### Theoretical Threats
- #### Multimodal Systems (utilizing both known and theoretical areas)
	- Reason for use
	- Types of industries that use them
	- Others...?
